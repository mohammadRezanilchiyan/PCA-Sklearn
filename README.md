Distribution Patterns:
Iris-setosa: The sepal lengths of Iris-setosa primarily cluster around 5 to 6 cm. The highest frequency of sepal lengths is around 5.0 to 5.5 cm.

Iris-versicolor: The sepal lengths of Iris-versicolor are more spread out compared to Iris-setosa, with a noticeable peak around 6 cm.

Iris-virginica: The sepal lengths of Iris-virginica show a wider range, generally longer than those of Iris-setosa and Iris-versicolor, with a peak frequency around 6.5 to 7 cm.



Overlap and Separation:
The histogram shows some overlap between the sepal lengths of Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica, particularly around the 6 to 7 cm range.
Iris-setosaâ€™s sepal lengths tend to be shorter and less overlapping with the other two species, indicating better separability based on sepal length alone.
